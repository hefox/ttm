## Talk to m3

The real intent of this is site is to play around with python/app engine.

The idea is to make a messaging app where people of similar interests can talk
to each other based on location.

It's been worked on in my limited free time with grand knowledge of python.
It's pure fun project with full understanding that no one would actually use it.

The website version is available http://talk-to-m3.appspot.com/
